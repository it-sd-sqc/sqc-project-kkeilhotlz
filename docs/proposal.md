Counting Common Words/Punctuation in Books
==========================================

For my proposed project, I want to take and scan 
through the whole book, and tally all of the punctuation/
commonly used words and see the total amount of said things,
throughout the whole book.

The first book I propose is [The night of no moon](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/71530) by 
H. B. Fyfe.
